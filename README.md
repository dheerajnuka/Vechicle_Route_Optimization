## Data Dictionary â€” Vehicle Route Optimization

This table documents each column in the route output.

| Column name | Description |
|---|---|
| Vehicle ID | Unique identifier of the vehicle running the route/stop. |
| Store ID | Unique identifier of the delivery/pickup location (customer/site). |
| Cube | Volume to deliver/pick up at this stop (e.g., cubic ft/m). |
| Remaining Cube | Vehicleâ€™s remaining usable volume **after** servicing this stop. |
| Arrival Time | Planned time the vehicle reaches the stop (before any waiting). |
| departure_time | Time the vehicle leaves the stop after service is completed. |
| Suggested Store Open Time | Earliest recommended store opening time used by planning rules. |
| Adjusted Arrival Time | Arrival shifted to respect opening hours/time-windows/breaks. |
| Minutes_of_service | Total service duration at the stop (unload, paperwork, scan, etc.). |
| layover_route | Flag/identifier for a planned layover/break inserted in the route. |
| New Wait Time | Recomputed wait after any arrival adjustments/layovers. |
| Window Start | Earliest allowed service start time at the stop (time window). |
| Window End | Latest allowed service start/finish boundary at the stop (time window). |
| Distance to Next | Road distance from this stop to the next planned stop. |
| Travel Time to Next | Estimated driving time to the next stop. |
| Wait Time | Time spent waiting if arriving before the service window/open time. |
| Unloading Time | Portion of service time specifically for unloading goods. |
| Validation | Result/status of constraint checks (on-time, capacity, length, etc.). |
| Max Trailer Length (Store) | Longest trailer the location can accommodate. |
| Vehicle Trailer Length | Trailer length of the assigned vehicle. |
| Store Preferred Vehicle Type | Preferred truck/class/features for the location (e.g., reefer, liftgate). |
| Vehicle Type | Actual vehicle class/type used for this stop/route. |
| Dispatch Date | Operating date for the route/stop plan. |
| Coordinate | Latitude/longitude of the store/location. |

**Typical relationships**
- `AdjustedArrival = max(Arrival Time, Window Start, Suggested Store Open Time)`
- `Wait Time = max(0, Window Start âˆ’ Arrival Time)`
- `New Wait Time = max(0, Window Start âˆ’ Adjusted Arrival Time)`
- `departure_time = Adjusted Arrival Time + Minutes_of_service`
- `Remaining Cube(next) = Remaining Cube(current) âˆ’ Cube` (deliveries)



## Vehicle Summary â€” Data Dictionary

This table documents the vehicle-level (per-route) summary fields.

| Column name | Description |
|---|---|
| Vehicle ID | Unique identifier for the vehicle whose route summary this is. |
| Total Stores | Number of stops/locations served on the route. |
| Start Time | Planned departure time from the depot or first location. |
| End Time | Planned finish/return time for the route. |
| Total Distance | Total planned driving distance for the route (km or mi). |
| Total Load | Total volume/weight serviced on the route (e.g., sum of delivered cube/weight). |
| Total Wait Time | Aggregate waiting time across all stops (arrivals before window/opening). |
| Vehicle Type | Actual vehicle class used (e.g., 26â€™ box, reefer, tail-lift). |
| Time Travel (hours) | Total driving time for the route in hours. |
| capacity | Vehicleâ€™s rated capacity (volume or weight) at dispatch. |
| new_capacity | Remaining unused capacity at route end: `capacity âˆ’ Total Load`. |
| vehicle_types | Allowed/compatible vehicle categories considered by the model (if modeled as a set). |
| Trailer Utilization (%) | Percent of capacity used: `(Total Load / capacity) Ã— 100`. |
| Haul Type | Route classification (e.g., linehaul, local, backhaul, milk-run). |

> **Notes:** Units should be stated consistently for distance (km/mi) and load (volume/weight). Time fields should be in a single timezone and format (e.g., ISO 8601).
